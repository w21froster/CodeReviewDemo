# CPTS 321 - Code Review Demo - 11/14/2022
This repo shows some base code in the main branch and another feature branch created by the new intern at MetaGooFlix. 
We will take a look at the pull request from the intern and discuss as a class what is wrong with it. 
Please feel free to comment on the pull request during class and feel free to ask clarifying questions while we do the code review demo.

A checklist of important aspects of the code review that we should explore are listed below:
- [ ] Is it clear what the changes are supposed to accomplish?
- [ ] Is the commit history clear and make sense?
- [ ] Are there logical errors or defects?
- [ ] Is there a consistent coding style? (variable names, function names, bracket placement, etc.)
- [ ] Is there a better way some logic could be implemented?
- [ ] Are there edge cases that are not being considered?
- [ ] Did the author comment anything? Are they useful?
- [ ] Are there test cases for the pull request?
- [ ] Does the code compile?
- [ ] Does the code have any StyleCop warnings?
